### About me

Hi, I'm Matthew, a third-year computer engineering student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I mostly work on web stuff with the occasional low-level project. Please feel free to leave an issue on any of my repositories if you want something added or have a question.

### Currently working on

- finishing up on [domain search](github.com/matthew-chandler/domain-search)
- a couple private repos that will go public at some point ðŸ˜„

### My websites
1. [EPS View](eps.machandler.com), a web tool that automatically generates a graph and table for any publicly-traded stock ticker
2. [Domain Search](domains.machandler.com), a web tool that checks if a list of domain names are available to be registered on a registrar
