### About me

Hi, I'm Matthew, a second-year computer engineering student at UCLA. I mostly work on web stuff with the occasional low-level project. Please feel free to leave an issue on any of my repositories if you want something added or have a question.

### Currently working on

- finishing up on [domain search](github.com/matthew-chandler/domain-search)
- using stripe API to convert prepaid debit cards to cash

### My websites
1. [EPS View](eps.machandler.com), a web tool that automatically generates a graph and table for any publicly-traded stock ticker
2. [Domain Search](domains.machandler.com), a web tool that checks if a list of domain names are available to be registered on a registrar

Here's a picture of me chilling with some cats at UCLA.
